#Unciv-witcher-mod

The witcher mod aims to add a civ that has a unique unit which is so strong, you need a small army to take it down, but this unit has a production cost of 500, which is more than most pre-modern wonders.

unit: Witcher
strength: 50
movement: 4
production cost: 500

This mod and it's lore is based on "the Witcher" by CDPR.

This mod is unfinished, and i'm still working on it. When it's done, the mod will have :

1 civ,
1 unique unit,
1 building,
a unique ability,
icons for the units and the civ,
and a penalty for having too many witchers since you are not supposed to have more than at most 3.
